The timetable management tool is a web application designed to automatically generate schedules while satisfying the constraints and preferences of teachers. Its main objective is to facilitate communication between department heads and teachers by optimizing class scheduling and reducing schedule conflicts. Through this application, timetable management becomes more efficient and transparent, thereby improving coordination within the institution.\\

In this report, we will detail the various stages of the project's implementation as well as the tools we used to successfully complete our work.\\

We will begin by presenting the general context of the project, followed by a description of the design and the main idea of the application. Finally, we will address the technical aspect of our application, including the tools and technologies we learned and implemented.
